# Medical Dataset Analysis - Codecademy Portfolio Project

In this folder, I analyse the dataset 'insurance.csv' to explore the following questions:

- What is the average age of people in the dataset?
- What is the average annual cost of insurance for people in the dataset?
- How does the average insurance cost differ for people with no children vs people with 1 child, 2 children and 3+ children?
- Is there any notable variations in insurance costs for people with a similar lifestyle depending on where they live?
- Are smokers are more or less likely to have children?
- Does having a high BMI contribute to higher insurance costs more than being a smoker?
- What is the difference in average insurance costs of non-smokers vs smokers?
